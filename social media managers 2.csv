I've lived in fantasy since I can remember and used movies as an escape from my reality. I want to make cinematic experiences for others looking for a movie to watch or for those looking for a new world to explore. 

Currently, I am generating videos to my YouTube channel in my pursuit to learn Adobe Premiere in more depth and build my portfolio. I am also exploring different creative outlets such as writing freestyle poetry and capturing moments with photography. 

I graduated with a double major in journalism and classics from Cal State Long Beach in pursuit of alternate routes to the film industry. During my time in college, I interned for the CSULB Office of the Provost as a social media and marketing intern as well as the Journalism Pubic Relations Department as their very first YouTube intern. I worked independently and collaboratively in these roles to produce video and social media content to boost awareness and education of the client. I also worked as the Museum of Latin American Art social media marketing intern. This role led me to edit a video featured in an art exhibit. 

Throughout these opportunities, I learned that I love social media, video, and filmmaking. I know that is my path and welcome any opening to advance in these fields.
